    <!-- In order to bind the newly created JavaScript file to our HTML so that it can run in the web browser, 
      we must reference it within the HTML file itself. Place the following code directly
       following the <title> tag and before the 
        closing tag of the <head> element: -->
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Just an HTML page...</h1>
    <p>We now know that our project boilerplate has been configured correctly since the HTML is 
      running and has effectively called code from within the JavaScript file. We now have the 
      beginnings of a web applicationâ€”complete with structure (HTML) and logic (JavaScript) 
      components.</p>

<!-- JavaScript Execution Order
This section hearkens back to an example from the previous chapter in terms of the various ways JavaScript
 can be included within a web document. There are two choices here: either include an external JavaScript
  file somewhere within the <head> tag or the <body> tag of your HTML document or embed the code directly 
    within the document itself, again at either location.

No matter how you include JavaScript within your HTML document, the web browser will always execute from 
top to bottom. Any JavaScript within the <head> tag of a document will execute before anything within 
  the <body> tag of the document. Of course, you can compartmentalize blocks of JavaScript code within 
    functions to execute when invoked as well, which effectively gets around this rule in some ways. -->

  <!-- Pbserve that alert that is there in JS file is displayed first and after that html <body> content is displayed -->
